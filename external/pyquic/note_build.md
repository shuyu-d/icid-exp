3. Build succeeded on MacOS 
(#720-2022) 
See fix in here: https://github.com/wouterboomsma/eigency/issues/32. Source of solution is in https://github.com/Jonathan-LeRoux/lws/issues/7#issuecomment-505667036. 

> I'm 99% sure that this was related to this issue: pandas-dev/pandas#23424. At the very least, following the advice there fixed it for me! Basically, XCode 10 made the switch from libstdc++ to libc++, and because of some crazy shit here that is dependent on how you installed distutils, as well as whether you used to have older versions of Xcode installed, you may or may not have this bug.

> Complex.h is on my machine (MacOS 10.13.4, Xcode 9.3) in /Applications/Xcode.app/... (use find to look for all the usr/include directories). That should be automatically included in Xcode search paths as part of the system search paths. Note that it is NOT in /usr/include.

> There are quite a few folks that have been using Matlab with Xcode/clang on a Mac. Setup is a little tricky because of the Xcode architecture, but, it has been done. Searching the web, especially at mathworks.com, should give you some hints. If you've installed the command line tools, it may be a little easier since clang/clang++ are installed in /usr.
